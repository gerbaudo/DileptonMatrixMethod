Summary of the various matrices.
As a rule of thumb, always pick the latest one.

- FakeMatrix_May_14.root as May_10 but with hack-last-mu-bin and syst unc
- FakeMatrix_May_10.root as May 04, but Ana_2LWH instead of python iso
- FakeMatrix_May_04.root as Mar 18, but with wh tight def
- FakeMatrix_hlfv_Mar_18.root as Mar_12, but consider emu and mue when extracting el fake
- FakeMatrix_hlfv_Feb_17.root as Mar_12, but from the hlfv area
- FakeMatrix_Mar_12.root: fix, require tag to be tight
- FakeMatrix_Mar_02.root: with 2d pt_eta
- FakeMatrix_Feb_18: after bugfix tight def (still rates from ss data) 
- FakeMatrix_Feb_02_loose_iso: denominator (loose) only drops isolation req, keeps PV requirements
- FakeMatrix_Dec_10 : for hlfv, same as Dec_09, hf-sf=1.3
- FakeMatrix_Dec_09 : for hlfv, updated efficiencies and compositions (both Dec_01); hf-sf=1.0
- FakeMatrix_Dec_03 : for razor, weighted avg razor and same-sign; hf-sf=1.0, mdr>20
- FakeMatrix_Nov_26.root razor with flat qcd sf (both el and mu), no mdr cut in composition
- FakeMatrix_Oct_28.root lfv with updated muon SF (use with 1d param)
- Nov_04: same as Oct_28, but now also with flat 1.0 elec qcd scale factor
- Oct_28: with muon scale factor from same-sign
- FinalFakeHist_Feb_02.root : after bugfix github.com/gerbaudo/SusyTest0/commit/ffbd20a6, otherwise same as Jan_31
- FinalFakeHist_Jan_31.root : channel-agnostic prediction with n_j>0 extraction region
- FinalFakeHist_Jan_29.root : add channel-agnostic sr/cr; tag Jan_29
- FinalFakeHist_Jan_28.root : new CRs, new matrix (90-eff iso, nj>0+metrel>20 extr reg)
- FinalFakeHist_Jan_02.root : add matrix for 90% eff operating point
- FinalFakeHist_Nov_10.root : first matrix from Davide, consistent with forDavide_Sep11
- forDavide_Sep11_2013.root : reference from Matt, with signal regions from June optimization
- pass3_Summer2013.root     : latest input from Matt before migration, for reference
